## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. How are hypothesis testing and confidence intervals related? (**4 Points**)

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Suppose I calculate a p-value of 0.08.  What is there an 8\% probability of? (**4 Points**)

*Your answer here...*

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

For the following question, use [data on the heights and weights of the 2022-23 NBA and WNBA all-stars](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ311/data/bball_allstars.csv).

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read data into R.  Call the dataset `bball`. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Remove any columns with missing data. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the row of the youngest player. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create two summary statistics tables -- one for the NBA players, and one for the WNBA players. Include only variables for age, height, and weight. Comment on the differences. (**4 Points**)

```{r results='hold'}
# Your code here...
```

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Which player(s) is taller relative to their respective league: the tallest NBA player(s) or the tallest WNBA player(s)? *Hint*: use Z-Scores! It might even be helpful to write a function to calculate Z-Scores to minimize the total amount of code you need to write. (**4 Points**)

::: {.aside}
Do not manually type the player names / heights, use code to select the player's info. 
:::

```{r results='hold'}
# Your code here...
```

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create and print a 95\% confidence interval for WNBA heights. (**4 Points**)

```{r results='hold'}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. What percentage of WNBA observations fall inside this confidence interval? Is there a percentage of observations we should *expect* to fall inside this interval? (**4 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. I have a hypothesis that older players are heavier than younger players.^[Define "young" as 25 or younger.] Use `t.test()` to preform a hypothesis test comparing weights of young and old players. What is the conclusion of the test? Interpret the test's p-value *in words*. (**4 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Navigate to the following website: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/county/time-series/](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/county/time-series/) On this website, you should see the following options:

<ol>
- Parameter: keep this as "Average Temperature".
- Time Scale: keep this as "1-Month".
- Month: set this to your birth month.
- Start Year: set this to your birth year.
- End Year: set this to "2024".
- State: set this to the state you were born in.  If you were not born in the United States, choose the first state in which you lived.
- County: set this to the county you were born in (or the first county you lived in).
</ol>

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Once these options are set, click the "Plot" button, scroll down below the generated plot, and right-click on the "CSV" download button. Copy the hyperlink address, and read it into R using `read.csv()`. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Clean the data so it appears more like a "normal" `data.frame`. (**4 Points**) For example, using `head(temp)`, the output is:

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Recreate the plot on the website.  You may ignore the right-hand celsius axis, the "&deg; F" on the left-hand axis, the background grid, the "NOAA" logo, and the shaded area beneath the time series. (**4 Points**) However, **extra credit** (**5 *Bonus* Points**) will be given to the person who can get the closest to an exact replication.

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Make a new column that is the z-score for each observation. Use the 1901-2000 average as the mean in the calculation. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Print the row with the largest z-score. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Assuming temperatures come from a normal distribution, what is the probability of observing a temperature this high (or higher)? (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```
