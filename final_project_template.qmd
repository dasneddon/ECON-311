*For some guidance on what your project should look like, check out this [sample paper by Dr. Tomas Dvorak](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/muse.union.edu/dist/d/377/files/2016/05/sample_paper.pdf).*

## Introduction

*Motivate and introduce your topic. Convince the reader that this topic/question is important and that they should care. What data do you use? How do you model your outcome variable(s)? What do you find? What is learned from your analysis?*

For a "how to" on writing introductions, see [Keith Head's Introduction Formula](https://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula).

## Literature Review

*What work has already been done on this topic by others? What are their conclusions? How is your work different? If your topic is time-sensitive or in the news, you may discuss current events here as well.*

## Data

*Where does your data come from? Why is this data good for answering your question? Be sure to create, and discuss, a summary statistics table and some plots.*

```{r}
# Code here.
```

## Empirical Model

*Write down the model(s) you estimate. Explain your modeling choices (e.g. log(), etc.). List out your hypotheses and the rationales behind them.*

$$\text{Outcome}_{it} = \alpha + \delta D_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$

For inline equations, only use a single dollar sign like: $\overline{Y} = \widehat{m}\overline{X} + \widehat{b}$.

## Results

*Discuss the results of your analysis. Interpret the coefficients.*

```{r}
2 + 2
```

## Conclusion

*Remind the reader of your topic, why it is important, and what you find. Be sure to include a discussion of the implications of your findings.*

Marc Bellemare has a helpful [Conclusion Formula](https://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12060) in response to Dr. Head's.
