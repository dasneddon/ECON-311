## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

For this question, you will have to put together two sets of data.  First, you will use college/university statistics from 1995's issue of US News and World Report ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/ISLR/College.csv), [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ISLR/College.html)).  Second, you will use earnings data of students from a variety of colleges/universities from College Scorecard ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/causaldata/scorecard.csv), [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/causaldata/scorecard.html)).

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read in the US News and World Report data.  Save it as a data frame called `usnwr`. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read in the College Scorecard data into a data frame called `scorecard`. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Remove all observations from `scorecard` that do not come from 2007. Next, merge `earnings_med` from `scorecard` into `usnwr` by institution. (**4 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Generate a summary statistics table for median student earnings, whether the school is private, the acceptance rate, size of the student body, student/faculty ratio, and instructional expenditure per student. **Note**: you will need to modify/create some of these variables. (**4 Points**)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate a regression where median student earnings (log) are explained by whether the school is private, the acceptance rate, size of the student body (log), student/faculty ratio, and instructional expenditure per student (log). Display the coefficient estimates (using `summary()` is fine). (**3 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret the coefficients. (**5 Points**)

## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Suppose I record data on how many hours my students spend studying and sleeping the week before an exam.  I am curious about how sleep and study quantities impact grade outcomes, so I use the data to estimate the parameters in the following model:

$$\text{Grade} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Sleep} + \beta_2\text{Study}$$

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Interpret each coefficient in words. (**3 Points**)

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Suppose I am interested in how time spent doing other things will impact exam grades.  How will the regression be effected if I add another variable named "Other" defined as $\text{Other} = 24 - \text{Sleep} - \text{Study}$? (**2 Points**)

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. What would you expect to happen to $\beta_2$ if I added a new variable called $\text{IQ}$ to the model above? (**2 Points**)

*Your answer here...*



## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

The quality of wine is highly subjective.  In any case, having a wine that is highly rated by experts will surely increase sales.  Examine these data on [red](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ311/data/winequality-red.csv) and [white](https://alexcardazzi.github.io/econ311/data/winequality-white.csv) wines for this question.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read both datasets into R. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create summary statistics tables for `quality`, `pH`, and `residual.sugar` for red and white wine separately. (**4 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Create a new column in both datasets called `red`.  For red wines, this should be equal to one and for white wine this should be equal to zero. (**1 Point**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Merge the two datasets and call the result `wine`. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Plot the average quality by alcohol content^[For this question, round alcohol content to the nearest tenths place.] for both wine types on the same set of axes.  Include a legend, axis labels, etc.  What does this plot suggest to you? (**4 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

*Your answer here...*

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. The `pH` variable measures the acidity of the wine.  The pH scale runs from 0 to 14 with lower numbers being more acidic and 7 being neutral (e.g. [water](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/chesswatch/media/chesswatch/ph-range-chalk-rivers.jpg){preview-link=true}).  Convert `pH` into a variable called `acidity` where higher numbers mean higher acidity. (**2 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Estimate the following model for red and white wines separately, and present the parameters in a table. (**2 Points**)

$$Q_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Alcohol}_i + \beta_2\text{Acidity}_i + \beta_3 \text{Sugar}_i + \epsilon_i$$

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Discuss the similarities and differences in the model outputs. How would you interpret the coefficients? *Hint*: what type of variable is quality? (**6 Points**)
