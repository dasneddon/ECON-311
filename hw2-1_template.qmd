## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. I send out a survey to individuals who graduated from ODU. I ask them to report their salary.  Most people fill out the salary question, but some people leave it blank. Can I fill in zero for these blanks? Explain why or why not. (**4 Points**)

This would be a faulty assumption. Salary is a ratio measurement which has a natural zero. Since a zero entered for salary would mean the person has a salary of zero. This is different than no value for salary, the actual value of which could be anything. Arbitrarily entering "0" for an NA value would skew the sample.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Suppose I decided to pick students with ID numbers that end in an 8 to survey.  I calculate the mean salary of those who submitted salaries.  Will this average salary be representative of all ODU students?  Explain why or why not. (**4 Points**)

This sample would be representative of all ODU students assuming the final digit in ODU student numbers is random and "all ODU students" is meant as "all ODU graduates". By design we are collecting data for ODU graduates, so ODU students that do not go on to graduate from ODU due to transfer or otherwise would not be represented. 

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Continuing from above, if you think think the salary will be representative, explain a way one could survey students where the resulting average *would not* be representative.  If you think the above salary will not be representative, explain a way one could survey students where the resulting average *would* be representative. (**4 Points**)

To make the the result not representative of all ODU (bachelor's graduates?) you could choose to only survey Strome graduates. Or only survey graduates that graduated within a short time frame, as time since graduation would be endogenous to salary. On the other hand, by not limiting to a time frame there is the possibility of heteroscedacity being introduced.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Why do we use the sum of squared differences when calculating dispersion? (**4 Points**)

The sum of deviations from the mean is always zero. The square of the deviation increases exponentially as the deviation increases thereby making dispersion measurable.



## Question `r Q <- Q+1; Q`

```{r include=FALSE}
q <- 0
```

Use the state-year cigarette panel data from the previous module ([data](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Cigar.csv); [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Ecdat/Cigar.html)) for this question.

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Read in the data, and present summary statistics for price, population, cpi, disposable income, and cigarette sales. Include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Use the package(s) from the course notes.  (**8 Points**)

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
# use this every time you want to use 'modelsummary'
library("modelsummary")
# add this line when loading 'modelsummary', too
options("modelsummary_factory_default" = "kableExtra")
cig_data <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Cigar.csv")
title <- "Cigarette Data - Summary Statistics"
frmla <- (`Price` = price) + (`CPI` = cpi) + (`Disposable Income per captia` = ndi) + (`Cigarette Sales` = sales) ~ (`N` = length) + Mean + (`St. Dev.` = sd) + (`Min` = min) + (`Max` = max)
datasummary(frmla, data = cig_data, title = title, fmt = fmt_significant(2))
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Write your own function to calculate a weighted average. As a hint, your function should accept two arguments: one for values and one for weights. (**4 Points**)

```{r}
wtdmean <- function(val,wt){
  valwt <- val
  for (i in 1:length(val)){
    valwt[i] <- as.numeric(valwt[i]) * as.numeric(wt[i])
    }
  return((sum(valwt))/(sum(wt)))
}
```


`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Use your function to find the population-weighted average of income. Aside from the formulas being different, provide an intuitive explanation for the difference you observe between the weighted average and the simple average. (**4 Points**)

```{r}
wtdmean(cig_data$ndi, cig_data$pop)
```

This produces and average where higher populations have a higher impact on the mean income. As the income measure is per capita, this gives a closer approximation of the average income of the sample.


`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Produce a visualization of the distribution of cigarette pack prices. Include a vertical, dashed, and colored (you may choose the color) line representing the mean price. Be sure to label the axes, etc. Provide a short description of what you see. (**5 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```

`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Produce a scatterplot of price ($X$) vs minimum price of adjoining states ($Y$). Use filled in circles as the point type. Color the points based on whether price is greater than the minimum price of adjoining states. Be sure to label the axes, etc. (**5 Points**)

```{r}
# Your code here...
```


`r q <- q+1; letters[q]`. Below is a time series of the pack sales by state over time. Recreate this plot to the best of your ability. Regardless of whether you were able to perfectly recreate the picture, what was the hardest part? (**8 Points**)
